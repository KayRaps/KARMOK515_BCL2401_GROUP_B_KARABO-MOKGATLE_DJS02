## Whole Number Dividend - Project for HTML, JavaScript, and CSS

This project offers a straightforward webpage for dividing whole numbers (integer quotient). For functionality and styling, it makes use of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

## Qualities:

Dividend and divider values are entered by the user in different input boxes.
The division calculation is started by clicking the "Calculate" button.
The entire number quotient is visible in the result, which is shown beneath the form.
Error handling stops non-numeric and zero-based division.

##Documents:

The main HTML file, index.html, references CSS and JavaScript files and contains the page structure.
The JavaScript code that manages data extraction, division logic, form submission, and error handling is called scripts.js.
The file styles.css is missing: a CSS file that is optional but styles the webpage (buttons, error messages, etc.).

## Guidelines:

Make sure you have JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files that are kept in the same location.
Use your web browser to open index.html to start the application.
Fill in the dividend and divider fields with values.
To divide, click on the "Calculate" button.
The entire number quotient will be shown in the result, which is shown beneath the form.

## Error Resolution:

An error message is displayed by the application if:

The field labeled as dividend or divider remains unfilled.
Other characters than numbers (0â€“9) are present in the input.
A division by zero is attempted by the user.

This code demonstrates a well-structured approach to handling form submissions for division calculations. It includes basic and advanced error handling to ensure user input validity and prevent unexpected behavior.
